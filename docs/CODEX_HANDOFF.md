# Codex Handoff

## Scope Completed

Stage 1 and Stage 2 only.

Implemented:

- repo digests for `../GenEvolve`, `../Gen-Searcher`, and `../GenEval`
- codebase map
- Python package skeleton
- diagnostic normalizer
- trajectory dataclasses and stdlib validator
- tool and skill registries
- Geneval retry skill YAML
- teacher API placeholder config
- JSON schema
- minimal diagnostic and retry examples
- README safe commands

Not implemented by instruction:

- teacher API client
- full retry loop
- image generation
- RL
- training
- web search integration
- raw GenEval evaluator adapter

## Safety Notes

- No dependency installation commands were run.
- No writes were made outside the current `gen-retry` repository.
- `../GenEvolve`, `../Gen-Searcher`, and `../GenEval` were treated as read-only.
- No GitHub push or PR command was run.

## Dependency Notes

No external dependency is required for the Stage 2 package skeleton or the requested safe checks.

Full future functionality will likely require prepared environments for:

- OpenAI-compatible API client usage.
- Geneval evaluator dependencies (`torch`, `mmdet`, `open_clip`, `pandas`, `PIL`).
- training and RL stacks.

These were not installed or invoked locally.

## Validation Results

- `python3 scripts/safe_check.py` - passed.
- `python3 -m compileall src scripts tests` - passed.
- `python3 -m json.tool examples/geneval_diagnostic_example.json` - passed.
- `python3 -m json.tool examples/geneval_retry_example.json` - passed.

`python -m pytest tests` was not run because the user restricted validation to the safe stdlib-only command list for this unattended pass.

## Blockers

None.
